    <p>I don't use the internet too often, but here are some things that I do use regularly</p>
    
    <h2>Favorite Game</h2>
    <p>Here is the wiki to my favorite video game! It makes it easier to understand how the game is played and what items to use.</p>
    <a href="https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac:_Rebirth_Wiki">Binding of Isaac</a>
    
    <h2>Most Used Social Media Site</h2>
    <p>Twitter is definitely my favorite social media site to use. There are many interesting things happening and it seems to be the most grounded in reality.</p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/?lang=en">Twitter</a>
    
    <h2>Cool AI Art Generator</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favorite websites because of the endless possibilities it can allow. I can type any prompt into the bar and it will create a digital art piece from scratch!</p>
