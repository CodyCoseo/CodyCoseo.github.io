        		What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.

        		I admire Jon Bernthal for the following reasons.
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>He is a very brave man because of the values that he stands for on a daily basis</li>
        		<li>He has a podcast that outlines men's mental health and other problems that people have to deal with</li>
        		<li>The message that he displays is one of kindness and assistance</li>
        		<li>There are tons of people who look to him as a role model</li>
        		<li>He shows the world that dreams can be accomplished no matter what adversities lay ahead pf you
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		There are many values and attributes that Jon Bernthal instills in his audience which are admirable. I believe that having real conversations with real people who are struggling or who have been through horrific experiences is extremely important. Having a large following and backing that up with a genuine personality will always gain my respect.
