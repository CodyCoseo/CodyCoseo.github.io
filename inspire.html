        		What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.

        		There are many values and attributes that Jon Bernthal instills in his audience which are admirable. I believe that having real conversations with real people who are struggling or who have been through horrific experiences is extremely important. Having a large following and backing that up with a genuine personality will always gain my respect.
